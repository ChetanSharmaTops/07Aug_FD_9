    <h1>IIFE Function</h1>
    <p>
      An immediately invoked function expression, or IIFE (pronounced iffy), is
      a function that is called immediately after it is defined.
    </p>
    <p>Functions are treated as First-Class Citizens in JavaScript.</p>

    <script>
      (function () {
        console.log("Namaste Bharat");
      })();

      // 1. () => the first parenthesis is used to make a IIFE function
      // 2. () => The second set of parenthesis is used to call the IIFE function
    </script>
